The day before the English test, I dwelled on the debating matters and a flash struck me -- yy should have had the ability to participate in it.

But how could I face her? I seemingly realized I went my own way by
overwhelming her with my so-called reputation. I happened to read those
sentences "Being human, we are imperfect. That's why we need each other, to carry each other when we falter, to encourage each other when we lose heart. Some may lead, some may follow, but none of us can go it alone. The changes we are working for are changes that we can only accomplish together." I tried to recite its Chinese meanings so that I could quote it though the quotation may be regraded as the humor of a scholar.

The regretful heat of students and the flames of the teachers mixed together after the grades came out. While experiencing painstaking study, we, especially students who live in dormitory, looked more eagerly forward to the College Entrance Exam when we would be free from here. Under such atmosphere, yy who always had an optimistic attitude towards working disappeared as a result of getting sick.

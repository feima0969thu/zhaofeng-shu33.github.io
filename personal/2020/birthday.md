# Birthday
2020/7/11

Everything was happening according to schedule until Yang Bai asked me to recommend
some good boy to her.

I booked a birthday cake and took it out at the cake store. Then I went to
the scheduled restaurant called "coco chicken". Yang Bai had came to occupy
a place. Actually I had came to book for a place three days before but it does not
matter since there were empty places at the time of 6:30 pm.

To my surprise, Yang Bai talked about some noble things like the right way to behave
in profession and social life. I thought it was different.  When we parted, Yang told
me she had reached the graduate goal and I suddenly knew the reason why Yang did not
talk much about paper any more.

Indeed, we behave differently in different situations. When the biggest pressure
is removed, you can think more about spiritual pursuit but for other students,
it still needs a hard balance between life and interests.

I recommended Xinyi Tong to Yang. This student insists more on ideal than me in my view.
I do not know what Yang Bai is thinking about and I felt a little depressed when Yang told
me she would have a try.

Going through the process of revising basic knowledge,
some teachers are critical about many kinds of petty errors made by us.
What we have memorized often corresponds with the sentences printed on
the textbook. Then Mrs leads us to a state of condemning ourselves.
While we are musing on our blunders, pushing us too hard seems insensible. Future is always turned over as a new page, in which
we will inattentively read if we dwell on the agony of the past.

Sun Shoutai showed me his new diary book, it saids "Though
the wheel of years pushed us forward, though the tunnel of times buries our past, though the eternal truth accelerates our growing adolescence and makes our naive countenance lost..."

Guy Tai had hardly given the listening paper away when the music rang.
He got so anxious as to fling a pile towards the front row. As we
pridicted, some back students would nearly missed the beginning but
for Tai's timely distribution.

We seemed to get a free chance to escape from the monotonous sitting lifestyle. Though for just a while, after concealing two-week-long
P.E. lessons, we, represented by Chu Liang, ran downstairs with high glee. It was a quirk of fate that all the students present -- except
for injured students. As I can recollect, some basketball fans were still hiding under their quilts, attesting their hard-work
till very late time, but they would appear just before the ball game.
It was unusual in October to experience such a sweltering afternoon, in
which the natural creatures listless and the playground crowded with lively adolescents. To our dismay, the P.E. teacher bid our masculine boys "carry the stand (connected with recent sports meeting) to the bottom of the national flag pole." We rubbed our limbs, envying Wang Zhen, who led the remaining female fellows running a circle (We have a great view besides the second floor window, in the stadium). Much to
our dismay when the stand was found, three of us were equal enough to bear the porter-like errand.

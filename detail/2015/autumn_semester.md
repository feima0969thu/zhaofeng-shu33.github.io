# Talk with sister Peng
2015/10/18

Today I talked with study sister Peng about one fundamental problem, national identity. The approach is historical geography. Another voice told me that the consumption of time on this unbounded problem should be limited. Words can have a tunnel to go out. However, this kind of releasing is a kind of social activity. Oral communication has its advantages alongside with its enormous disadvantages. Young strength appeals for appropriate social activities. But this kind of appeal may be an illusion.

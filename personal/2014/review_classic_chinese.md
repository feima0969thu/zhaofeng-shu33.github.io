# Reread on two texts which I learned at Senior One
2014/11/21

Before I go to the main topic, I can not resist saying something about my changing ideas towards Chinese and Senior teachers. I believe you will not transmit my personal prejudices in this paragraph to other people. As outsiders, people including me may vaguely think higher education squeezed in students more details about knowledge of a given area, while our judging values on the previous learned nearly changed little. For example, about the status of works by modern Chinese writers in Chinese literature history. Maybe I have no qualification to give my voice on such important issues. But merely because of my long-prepared thesis on this topic, I totally changed my view on many "political" writers including Lao She, Cao Yu... although the latter is an alumnus of Tsinghua University. At this point I don’t intend to give my reason or argument about this topic, merely to emphasize my great change of view on many issues about Chinese. Some may be a little reactionary. For example, my eluding of using modern Chinese language to writing.

Briefly to speak, this language has its life no more than the life of new China. Although people in the period of Republic of China use the vernacular, but in written form it is in traditional characters, not the simplified characters. I merely feel the political compelling force in such change while regions of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan still use traditional characters. Writing language form has influential effects on people who use it. For example, the manner and habit of thinking and the potential ideology. At this point, I can not avoid simplified Chinese because of many textbooks. But I probably will not read modern Chinese literature, which is too near to the present time that many writers and books hold more fame than their level. Another part of this paragraph is related to my senior teachers. So many technical training has been forgotten quickly so far. I understood it a common training method shared by all teachers. Still there seemed to be a slight difference between so-called experienced old teachers and newly-starting young teachers. One point I’d like to mention is the presentation which was firstly conducted at Class 5 and 6 at Senior Two by you. Before every class a student is supposed to go up the platform and give a short speech. Although the target is not out of the College Entrance Examination compositions, the form is pretty “revolutionary. In fact, every English listening and speaking class at Tsinghua University requires every participator to give a presentation. Either speaking in Chinese or English, the content is selected out of life. At this point I don’t intend to recall what I put those presentations in mind at Senior two. But I’d like to stress the importance of ideas brought by such “activity”. The reason why I didn’t have any feelings towards some of my original teachers lies merely in that I can not remember any fresh ideas from them. But ideas are likely to be based on one’s tendency of study or life. Probably from the success story told by Sun Zhongkai at that time I can tell his “successful” future but almost what was Chinese. Probably from my non-orthodox ideas above and below you can tell my potential ideology and my attitudes toward Chinese.

All right, the first text I intend to say something is "In the government of my kingdom". I intended Mencius study class last semester, so my only strength while rereading this text is standing on the point of the whole book.

History background is of vital importance to make a great step towards understanding “In the government of my kingdom”. My Mencius teacher is of doing research on history of Pre-Qin, so she talked a little more about the history background, including the Liang Hui Wang. In combination with the first sentence from 1.5("There was not in the nation a stronger State than Jin, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me, on the east we have been defeated by Qi, and then my eldest son perished; on the west we have lost seven hundred li of territory to Qin; and on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Chu. I have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to wipe it away, once for all."), we can see why Mencius said “'Your majesty is fond of war - let me take an illustration from war.” But the concentration I tend to put on is Mencius’ theory of "benevolent government", which embodies relatively sufficiently in this small text.

From the criticism of Marxism, theory of benevolent government is returning to original social state where people were kept in a fixed place and treated as slave (to work and be fed, and be instilled ideology). Because it is out of date (at least dominator has no time to “educate” the people about "virtues") and contradicted to social development of Warring State, this theory is only ideal of Mencius which can never become true.

But inside the structure of benevolent government, we can not appreciate it with a pair of colorful glasses. Can we simply regard "the filial and fraternal duties" (the Confucian ideology) as the constricting force on people’s mind?  If a time is thought to be turbulent times, is there no possibility that cure of Mencius can not be applied and work out? By the hindsight of modern citizens are there often degradation of Mencius as idealist and boaster. However, every one more or less has some hue of idealist and boaster, if not in politic now, at least at daily life. But Mencius is consistent. He expressed similar ideas of benevolent government in many occasions through the whole book. In a word to summary the content of benevolent government: Firstly, give people food and drink; then give people education and belief.

When Mencius met Liang Hui Wang，he encouraged him to put down his eagerness to take revenge on the state of Qi and told him how to treat his people wel; When Mencius met Qi Xuan Wang，he warned him the danger of competing with the state of Qin and Chu to seek hegemony and suggested the king to “institute a government whose action shall be benevolent”; When Mencius met Teng Wen Gong (king of a small kingdom), he comforted him not afraid of the state of Qi and Chu and strived to be good to his people. Aimed at different situation, Mencius can always adjust his specific contents of theory of benevolent government and apply it to solve difficult political problems. Return to this text, to solve how to attract people from neighboring kingdoms, Mencius spoke out his suggestions based on his theory. Mencius could not hide his criticism on the common behavior shared by almost all kings---cannot hold on while eager to seek hegemony, he called these phenomenon “猶七年之病而求三年之艾”. In this small text has already showed Mencius’ euphemistic criticism on king Liang. However, king Liang is very modest to Mencius’ criticism. After Mencius said, “Let your majesty cease to blame on the year”. Liang requested, ”I wish quietly to receive on your instructions”. Perhaps because of Liang’s modesty, Mencius said in detail about benevolent government to him. However, on seeing the son of Liang, 梁襄王，Mencius was more impolite. He only told 襄王brief and to the point：今夫天下之人牧，未有不嗜杀人者也。如有不嗜杀人者，则天下之民皆引领而望之矣, while the tone of  “王好戰，王無罪歲,天下之民至”, is pretty restrained. I think Mencius place more hope on 惠王, but the hope can never become reality. Just considering the fact that when Mencius was summoned to 魏，惠王 was very old and have no heart force to take care of state affairs. In addition, the thinking set（mode） of people was very hard to reverse. While the theory of 霸 (advocated by political strategists such as 公孫洐，張儀) was popular, how can the theory of benevolence be accepted by kings of powerful states? In fact, what Mencius criticize of 惠王 was his application to military force so that he can not spare money to poor people. An improper metaphor can be traced to 1958-1961, so-called “three-year natural disaster” in China. Is it contradicted to what Mencius said,”人死，則日，歲也。” Where are the money and relief substances? The mistakes of “Too eager” has been made after around 2000 years.

   From many lively examples can I return to book of Mencius. I think that is the power and value of classical works. About this kind of method of reading classics I was firstly inspired by  a group of true Marxists , who use original works of Marx and Engel to construct the unique history of modern China from 1949-2014. But if the target was aimed after 1978, it became one dangerous and controversial area to criticize on current issues. So I’d rather return to the history of Ming to reread the second text which I learned at Senior One,--“五人墓碑記” (Five Tombstones’ Inscription) with combination of what I read of movement of 復社(Fu Associations) and what I learned of Late Ming last semester). 
   I wondered why my Chinese teacher at that time didn’t tell us a term to call the event which was the background of this text---“開讀之變”. In external appearance it was like the event of Six Four in 1989, but it happened in 蘇州。But the internal character was absolutely different. The former was rooted in the struggle between 東林 party and eunuch party, headed by 魏忠賢 at that time (reign of 天啟). A group of literati gathered to protest the arrest of 周公，an important figure regarded as member of 東林 party at that time. This event (“開讀之變”) ended in a relative peaceful way by the voluntary confession of five brave literati, whose names have been mentioned in the inscription ( I don’t think they never heard “詩書之訓”，just like common people today also receive compulsory education and know a little about Chinese classical writing language . 
  Unlike Book of Mencius, works of 張溥 was far less known by people even in China. If we read some history books of Late Ming, his name was still scarcely mentioned because his political influence was tiny even though he can be counted as a famous litterateur at that time. Just now I watched a report about a young soldier who lost his life while joining to carry out anti-earthquake struggle in 云南 province. He is the figure of time while the five unknown literati were figures of history. So what was the meaning of rereading their deeds?
  天如（courtesy name of 張溥）said the meaning in the end of the text, “To show their meaning of dying and the contribution of their deeds to our country.”(translated by myself, while Mencius quotation was cited from online) At this point, I do not intend to talk about the moral issues which has been written over and over on our argumentative compositions. I intend to briefly analyze why 張天如 said in this way.
  Firstly, readers should have basic knowledge of Fu Associations, the footnotes given by textbook said “ it is an organization to criticize the court politics.” I think it was not accurate or misleading. Even Late Ming can not avoid the great influence of Imperial Exams. So if there were an organization grouped by specific political gangs, it can not attract so many young literati and become natural influential. My Ming history teacher summaries the essence of such associations as “specific groups for literati to study 八股 essays”. Take a similar example which happened at my Senior time, when I was Senior Two, I joined a literature club organized by a girl from Class 8. The aim of such club has been stated by her clearly at the start of the club as “to improve our composition scores of 高考.” Even so, the club did not exclude club members to write some prose or novels to spread within. It was similar with the situation of Fu Association. The difference was that the organizer was much more qualified because they passed successfully the Imperial Exams. Some historians think its influence reached as “士子不入社，必不得进身，有司不入社，必不得安位”. On the other hand, we should find out the political stand of such association. Still taking the short-lived literature club as example. The utilitarian goal can not be denied, but its literature standard draws a definite line with those false compositions. “Making story is not allowed in the composition of members” is a regulation made at the start of the club. The club header set good example to perform such regulations in her writing. This is similar to the condition of Fu Association. The leaders also required the members to apply what they learn to reality and made contribution to the country. Because of such regulations, members of Fu Association often give out impressions of integrity and responsibility. But we have to realize their moral rules are still bounded in the Confucian or 朱子doctrines. For example, “閹禍橫流，縉紳能不易志者鮮矣”, was saying in the tone of Mencius to emphasize meaning similar to“楊朱墨翟之言盈于天下，天下之人必二者之一而從之也.” Then the Five Literati can stand out,”,保全百姓，阻閹謀反，蕩平閹禍，是五人之力也”, similar to Mencius’ ”(而我)正人心，息邪说，距诐行，放淫辞，以承三圣”.
The reason of praise of people who did not attain higher education of Confucian in this text was explained by comparison between those higher official and Five Literati. In fact, I think the stress of Fu Association on practice of Confucianism produced such inscriptions. Although 八股essay has many advantages , the bad effect for intellectuals was the dislocation between action and words/writings. The start sentence of the last paragraph of the inscription is just describing such phenomenon. How to inject positive energy to the degenerating reading ethos was of vital importance to leader of nationwide literature association. Even saint Mencius said, “能言距杨、墨者，圣人之徒也”, not necessarily good at Pagu essay. However, the aim of majority of members in Fu Association joined it was only to pass the imperial exams more quickly and successfully. The inscriptions can not convince those contemporaries in Late Ming. How can we reckon on it to touch us in Capital-Colored Modern China?
     At the end I expressed my opinion in a haste. No reading means no right to speak. I should return to the more beneficial thing and try not to write so much next time.
     Best wishes

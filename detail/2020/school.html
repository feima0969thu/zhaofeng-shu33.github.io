	<h2>Going out</h2>
<p>2020/5/22</p>
<p>It is hard to go out of the campus in recent days. I have to find some obscure way along
the Dasha River. Still, the field workers stop me when I come back. They warn that I
can't do such thing any more.</p>
<h2>Reunion</h2>
<p>2020/5/26</p>
<p>Reunion with partial members of 2018 summer volunteer teaching students
since Shaoping is going to leave the campus tomorrow.

<h2>Climbing</h2>
<p>2020/7/15</p>
<p>This is the second time I went to TangLang Mountain with my roommate, Pengyang Zhao.
Usually I went climbing once a time every weak.</p>
<h2>Poem</h2>
<p>2020/7/16</p>
<p>When I went to iPark this morning, a poem flowed to my mind:</p>
<p>曾幻年来事非空
笔底飞鸿已无踪
春风杨柳花开日
粉面桃花人不同</p>

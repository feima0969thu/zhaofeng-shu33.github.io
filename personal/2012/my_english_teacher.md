# My English teacher

"Don't expect two much as long as you feel pleased." This is what our
Mrs Wei said in our last formal English class. No matter how much
my English has improved on amount of Revered Wei, I cherish to my deep
heart those hard-working memories with Mrs Wei, whether she will teacher me or not.

Do you remember her blame on our second mistakes, or third even fourth such as the usage of the word "blame". Her thoughtful sentences such
as "You must take notes of what I write on the blackboard while you
might need to put down those that I don't write down."; and her sense
of humor how and then such as the championship of Yunlong Party and
Haodong Party when the two were compelled to copy texts so that the
whole male species of Class 5 were divided into two parties to come to
their aid. All these embody her care for students, her enthusiasm
for career and shrewdness for life.

There is one thing about Wei that everyone remembered as if it happened yesterday.

# Death of Doctor Li
## 2020/2/6
I am shocked when I see so many friends comments on this news. It may be a symbol of the ongoing
coronavirus disaster in China. Yesterday a Poland friend and I went back from the discussion meetup
in a Russian restaurant. She asked me whether China blocked some websites and whether people protect.
It is hard to answer such question. But I know there is indeed influence of such policy, of the coronavirus on my life, on the life of each person of China.

We, students at the winter school from China, are worried about the undetermined destiny of the ongoing domestic disaster. Some flights between Russia and China have been canceled. And most of us have to choose Aeroflot, a Russian airplane company to go back.

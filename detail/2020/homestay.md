## Marriage and Babysitting
2020/4/3

The day before Qing Ming Festival, I went to offer sacrifices for my grandmother, with my father.
According my local traditions, we need to add new soils to the place where my grandmother is buried and burn some paper money for the dead.
After this formal rite, we went to talk with my elder cousin, who did business of furniture and made big money. My cousin told me to consider girlfriend and marriage as soon as possible and take
himself as a good example. I had little consideration on such matter previously but recently
I am reconsidering some realistic problems. As a common person, the right way is to graduate within five years, and find a good job, live in a big city, buy a good house, find a good wife
and have a lovely baby. All these should be accomplished within my future ten years in common sense. But in other hand, why we are soon anxious, anxious to fulfill the next step of lifespan
and anxious to be made sacrifices by our decedents?

## Server maintenance
2020/4/5

Recently Fei Ma is starving the server cluster of my lab again. He broke out the rules of 10TB
storage limit and asked for 10 GPUs. All were granted by Professor Yang Li. I am very unpleasant
about such greed behavior. Though the public resources have some residues, we need to take care
to fairly use it and leave some space for other users as well.

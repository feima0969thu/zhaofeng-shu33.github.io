# Where a loving story heading for?

created on my first semester of senior three

As the dim light of lampposts shined over the playground of our campus, discords rose from
the hard but gentle earth. I came across him and his lady and ran past them. I heard only the wind singing, not their instant whisper.

One is tall and handsome while the other is genial and beautiful. They were like other partners on the playground. One proficient in science, the other majoring in social science. They have no contradiction with each other Only harmony exists, I perceive.

During a brief break one night, the bell was to ring. I strolled slowly past her seat, where sat her temporary deskmate, that guy. Boys were fighting while girls were learning knowledge by heart, so that few classmates noticed their dating in public. Somehow her kind girl deskmate spoiled her otherwise where would she have been at that moment. Anyway his basketball teammates envied him but they would rather him to decline into desolate valley.

When she look her books from the special place under the computer when the exam finished, and when she leaned her head on the shoulder of him regardless of our pure students, how could this loving story end?

It was just several weeks ago that a pair of former partners of our class was accused by adults.
Maybe it won't be long before another affair ended in tragedy. Not only the two, but the rest of us, because of our standing by, are to blame. I'm reminded of a song called "We are the same" by Zhang Jie, which encouraged us to chase our dream fearlessly, nor to waste time in a fantasy love. You two, my friends, have a rude awaking! Where your romantic story heading for?
